# Statement of Hypotheses

## Claims to Test

### Lewis

* “That is what I claim: the unselective ∀ and ∃ can show up as the adverbs always and sometimes. Likewise never, usually, often, and seldom can serve as the unselective analogs of the selective quantifiers <i>for no x, for most x, for many x,</i> and <i>for few x.</i>” (Lewis 1975, p. 10)

* "The adverbs I wish to consider fall into six groups of near-synonyms, as follows:
<br>(1) Always, invariably, universally, without exception</br>
(2) Sometimes, occasionally, [once]</br>
(3) Never</br>
(4) Usually, mostly, generally, almost always, with few exceptions, [ordinarily], [normally]</br>
(5) Often, frequently, commonly</br>
(6) Seldom, infrequently, rarely, almost never</br>
<br>Bracketed items differ semantically from their list-mates in ways I shall not consider here; omit them if you prefer."(Lewis 1975, p. 5)</br>

## Tokens for Inclusion

* Adverbs: <i>Always, Usually, Mostly, Often, Frequently, Sometimes, Occasionally, Seldom, Rarely, Infrequently, Never</i>
* Determiners: <i>Every, Each, All, Most, Many, Some, [Several], [A Few], Few, No</i>

## Predictions

Speakers interpretations of the quantificational force of these quantifiers will form six distinct interpretive clusters:

* In Cluster 1, we should find interpretations of the adverb <i>always</i> as well as those of the determiners <i>every, each,</i> and <i>all</i>.

* In Cluster 2, we should find interpretations of the adverb <i>mostly</i> as well as <i>usually</i> as well as those of the determiner <i>most</i>.

* In Cluster 3, we should find interpretations of the adverbs <i>often</i> and <i>frequently</i> as well as those of the determiner <i>many.</i>

* In Cluster 4, we should find interpretations of the adverbs <i>sometimes</i> and <i>occasionally</i> as well as those of the determiners <i>some</i> and [<i>several</i>.]

* In Cluster 5, we should find interpretations of the adverbs <i>seldom, rarely</i> and <i>infrequently</i> as well as those of the determiners <i>a few</i> and <i>few</i>.

* In Cluster 6, we should find interpretations of the adverb <i>no</i> as well as those of the determiner <i>never.</i>
